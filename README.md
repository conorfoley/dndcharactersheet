This is a D&D Character Sheet with the goal of:
- Being responsive and easy to use
- Dynamically updating to give visual cues and responses to changes in your character
- Helping novice users understand how to prioritize attributes/modifiers based on class/race/etc.
- Capture all of the complexity of D&D in an easy to comprehend format

The style and layout definitely leave much to be desired, but this is a mock/prototype which will definitely
be built upon.

All of the options are fully customizable -- races, paths, alignment, even attributes are stored in JSON
format that can easily be modified or updated to cater to your needs.

Roadmap:
- Attributes across the left auto re-arrange based on priority (determined from class/race/etc.)
- Modifiers are auto-added/calculated based on class/race/specialization/weapons/etc.
- Users can upload their own avatar
- Eventually include additional tabs/buttons/navbar across the top for spells, feats, equipment, etc.
